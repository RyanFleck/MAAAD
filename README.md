# MAAAD

Mathematical Action At A Distance. Nodejs/SocketIO/Canvas webapp for teaching math.

### Project Goals:
- Create a collaborative whiteboard that can be connected to with a Room ID.
- System must be performant enough to run on a chromebook.
- System must be easy enough for a K-6 student to use. (Just open url & draw.)

Project started 20190201, but I have lots of schoolwork at this point in time.  
Probably won't get to working on this for a few weeks.
